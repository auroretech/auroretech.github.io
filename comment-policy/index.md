## Here’s what we like to see in comments:
**Give us useful, constructive criticism. Spot a typo or an error? Let us know and we will correct it.** <br/>
**Demonstrate and share the intelligence, wisdom, and humor we know you possess** <br/><br/>
## Although we can’t be everywhere at once, here are some of the kinds of comments we’re going to do our best to curtail:
**Racism, sexism, homophobia, you get the drift** <br/>
**Promoting your own brand, product, or blog** <br/>
**Threats — no matter how vague — against the author or other commenters**
